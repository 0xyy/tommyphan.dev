This website is my portfolio created with great animations and transitions with options to change language or dark mode.

It's a showcase of my skills along with the included information about me, my experience, etc.


## Demo

https://tommyphan.dev


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

**Animations and 3D models:** Three.js, Framer Motion, React Tilt

## Lessons Learned

While doing this project I learned a lot about using 3d models, great animations and transitions with popular libraries. I encountered problems with the 3d model and responsiveness to get the nice waves on the page to line up well but in the end I managed to do well. I also learned how to easily implement dark mode and internationalization. Overall I think this project is a good showcase of me.
